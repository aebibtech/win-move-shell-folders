# Move Windows Shell Folders

Moves Windows Shell Folders (e.g. Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc) to another Path. Written in PowerShell.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo.
2. You can pass a destination argument to the script if run from the command line (e.g. `.\Move-UserFiles.ps1 C:\Files`)
3. You can also run the script with no arguments. It will just ask for a path for the new Shell Folders location.
